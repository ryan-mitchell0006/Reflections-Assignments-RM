# Attend a workshop/event outside of class
### HIST 5152 Reflections Assignment

## About this assignment
Hands-on experience really is the best way to learn how to work with digital tools. We will work on small skills-oriented projects in our Lab during class, but this is a chance for you to engage with a topic or tool that is interesting or important to you personally in a structured, supportive environment.

### Due date
Due by November 28, 2022.

## Directions
1. Check out the Events calendar I've set up for this class to find a topic that you might be interested in. If you find one that isn't listed on the calendar, run it by me;  but it should be fine with me if you go to one of those, instead.
2. Once you've identified your event, make sure to register if necessary and check to see if you might need to prepare anything beforehand (sometimes, you might need to install some software or download a dataset or something along those lines to follow along in the workshop.) 
3. Then, make sure to attend it! Take notes along the way to help aid in your reflection process later.
4. Create a brief recap of the workshop/event answering the questions below.
5. Submit your materials.

## Guidelines for the recap
The recap can take the form of a written essay, a video, a screen recorded demo, an infographic, blog post, or just about any other medium you prefer. In your recap, briefly explain (in no more than 1250 words/ 10 minutes):

1. The name, date, topic, organizer, and other basic details of the workshop.
2. The structure of the workshop: how was it organized (thematically, step-by-step, etc.)? Give details about any processes, lectures, or preparatory work that made up the workshop.
3. How was your experience? Did you learn something new? Were there things that frustrated you, and if so, how did you overcome them (or how might they be overcome next time)?
4. Did you come away with an example/prototype/work-in-progress? Include a link or screenshot if possible.
5. What advice would you give to someone else who might be interested in learning more about this same topic?

<p>How can one describe the affect of the Internet? Dr. Lisa Nakamura summarized her thoughts on this unanswerable question in a succinct assertion: public feelings about the state of the Internet today can be described as pessimistic, riddled with feelings of disempowerment and jadedness. Dr. Nakamura grounded her discussion of the state of the digital world given at the University of Pennsylvania on October 17, 2022 in this generalization, arguing that Internet users feel as if any attempt to make meaningful interventions into racialized and divided online infrastructures would be futile. The panel discussion at the University of Pennsylvania‚Äôs Kelly Writers House branched into a discussion of the technological maneuvers made by the Internet‚Äôs corporate stakeholders that create such feelings, which Nakamura tempered by emphasizing the excellence of critical work flowing out of the academic today. Her perspective on the state of the field formed the foundation for a dynamic series of questions and answers that navigated central themes in her work, all of which relate to the multiple marginalizations that occur online and subsequently emanate into the lived realities of Internet users.</p> 
<p>Two discussants from the university, Dr. Whitney Trettien and Dr. Amanda Licastro, prompted Nakamura to address the race and gender-related concerns that arise in virtual space based on her own research, and the live responses of event attendees. Cases of the ‚ÄúZoombombing‚Äù phenomenon‚Äîan unfortunate phenomenon that arose after the transition to virtual work and schooling during the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äîallowed student participants and the speakers to share personal experiences for Nakamura to contextualize within her research. Driven overwhelmingly by racism, Nakamura described how ‚ÄúZoombombing‚Äù incidences differ from such disruptions to a physical class session or event in that the disrupted group cannot meet, discuss, and process the invasion as a group. Zoom room participants exit the room, receive a notification that the session has ended, and are left alone in front of a screen. A minor moment in the discussion, it would be the first of many to offer points of departure for Nakamura to expound the profound shortcomings of an Internet predicated on human deficiency and making one ‚Äúwhole.‚Äù</p>  
<p>Subsequent topics, such as the lack of collaboration in humanities writing and the failure of empathy when compared to the support one receives from creating communities, continuously returned to a notion of embodiment in physical and virtual spaces that I did not consider prior to the event. The written treatises by Nakamura assigned in class unpacked this topic at length; however, her responses to questions from the audience and discussants more effectively illustrated the disconnects between an Internet user‚Äôs virtually and physically embodied experiences. Nakamura‚Äôs analysis of life online described the act of opening a cell phone or laptop screen as a passage. Beyond the home screen or desktop, one inhabits a new, self-fashioned image in a universe that is both boundless and limited by the same societal stringencies. This other self is both of and apart from any Internet user, anchored in the physical realm but free to seek solace, comfort, knowledge, or violence depending on how one chooses to utilize a network-connected device. Nakamura‚Äôs discussion provided a guide to the infinite possibilities, spaces, and uses of the Internet that argued for collaboration and community-building as the path of potential interventionists seeking to effectively ameliorate the toxic racial, gender, and economic paradigms perpetuated online. Empathy, she repeatedly emphasized, is the opposite of this endeavor because it only demands that we continue to see the suffering of the marginalized reproduced ad nauseam.</p>  
<p>No prototype other than Nakamura‚Äôs call for continuous collaboration across humanities writing and digital projects emerged from the panel discussion; however, I have already pointed peers in the direction of the recorded October 17th panel and her writings. The disclaimer I provided related to the empathy question‚Äîencouraging an open mind when Nakamura complicates what many people would view as a positive feeling. Otherwise, the writing advice provided in the final sections of the panel is useful for anyone constantly seeking fresh ways to improve the quality of their essays and other writings.</p>
